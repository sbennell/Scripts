# Intune App Configuration
# ========================================

<#
For each organization, create separate Win32 apps with:

1. Different install commands (examples above)
2. Different background images in the package
3. Targeted to specific device groups
4. Named appropriately (e.g., "LockScreenInfo - Mother Teresa", "LockScreenInfo - Contoso")

This allows you to:
- Deploy different configurations to different organizations
- Use organization-specific branding and contact details
- Maintain separate deployment packages
- Target specific device groups per organization
