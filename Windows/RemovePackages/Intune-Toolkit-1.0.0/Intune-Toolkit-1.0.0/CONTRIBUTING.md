# Contributing to Intune-Toolkit

Thank you for considering contributing to the **Intune-Toolkit** project! We welcome contributions of all kinds, whether you're fixing a bug, improving documentation, or adding a new feature. Please take a moment to review the guidelines below to ensure that your contributions align with our standards.

## 1. How to Contribute

### 1.1 Reporting Bugs or Requesting Features
- **Search first:** Before creating a new issue, please search the [existing issues](https://github.com/MG-Cloudflow/Intune-Toolkit/issues) to ensure that the issue or feature request hasn’t been reported already.
- **Open an issue:** If you find a bug or have a feature request, open a new issue using the appropriate template:
  - **Bug Report:** Provide clear details about the problem, including steps to reproduce, environment information, and any logs/screenshots.
  - **Feature Request:** Describe the feature in detail, including why it would be useful and how you envision it working.
- **Provide context:** Be specific in your descriptions and provide as much context as possible to help us understand your needs and address the issue efficiently.

### 1.2 Contributing Code
- **Fork the repository:** Before making any changes, fork the repository and work on a new branch.
- **Follow the coding style:** Ensure your code follows the existing coding style of the project. Follow any formatting or linting rules outlined in the project.
- **Document your changes:** If you're adding a new feature or updating an existing one, make sure to update the documentation accordingly. Provide comments and write meaningful commit messages.
- **Test your changes:** Ensure that your code changes are thoroughly tested and don't introduce new bugs. If you're adding a new feature, consider writing tests to cover it.
  
### 1.3 Submitting a Pull Request
- **Create a pull request (PR):** Once you're ready to submit your changes, create a pull request to the main branch.
- **Reference related issues:** If your pull request addresses an issue, mention it in the pull request description (e.g., "Fixes #42").
- **Explain your changes:** Clearly describe the purpose of your changes and why they are necessary. If the pull request is large or complex, break it down into smaller, self-contained commits.
- **Be responsive:** If your PR receives feedback from the maintainers, respond promptly and make the requested changes. Discussions and reviews help improve the code quality.
- **Small, focused PRs:** When possible, submit small, incremental changes rather than large, sweeping ones. Smaller pull requests are easier to review and increase the chances of acceptance.

## 2. Code Style Guidelines

To maintain consistency across the project, all contributors should adhere to the following coding conventions:

- **Naming Conventions:** Use descriptive and meaningful names for variables, functions, and classes. Stick to common conventions such as camelCase for variables and functions, and PascalCase for class names.
- **Formatting:** Ensure your code is properly formatted with appropriate indentation. Use linters and formatters (if any are specified) to maintain consistency.
- **Comments:** Write clear and concise comments to explain complex logic or important decisions within the code. However, avoid over-commenting trivial parts of the code.

## 3. Commit Message Guidelines

To keep the Git history clean and readable, please follow these commit message guidelines:
- **Write in the imperative mood:** E.g., “Add feature,” not “Added feature” or “Adding feature.”
- **Keep it short:** Limit the first line of the commit message to 50 characters. If additional context is needed, add a longer description in the subsequent lines.
- **Reference issues:** If your commit relates to an issue, include a reference to it (e.g., `Fixes #42`).

Example commit message structure:
```
Add new feature to improve authentication flow

This update implements a new authentication method that reduces latency and increases security. It also fixes a bug in the previous implementation that caused incorrect login redirects.
```

## 4. Best Practices

- **Keep discussions respectful:** Constructive feedback is encouraged, but personal attacks or dismissive comments are not acceptable.
- **Collaborate early:** If you're working on a significant change, open an issue or reach out via the discussion board to get feedback early in the process.
- **Stay up-to-date:** Regularly pull in changes from the main branch to avoid merge conflicts and keep your branch up-to-date with the latest changes in the repository.
- **Work in progress (WIP):** If you want to get feedback on a pull request before it's finished, feel free to submit a "Work in Progress" PR. You can mark it as such using `[WIP]` in the PR title.
