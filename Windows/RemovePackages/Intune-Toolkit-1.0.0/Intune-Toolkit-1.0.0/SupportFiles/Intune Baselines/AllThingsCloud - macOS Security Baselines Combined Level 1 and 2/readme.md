# macOS Security Baselines Repository

## Overview
Securing macOS in an enterprise environment requires a fine balance between usability and security controls. While Microsoft Intune provides a robust platform for managing Apple devices, as of this writing it lacks built-in security baselines comparable to those available for Windows. This gap led me to create the **macOS Security Baselines** repository.

## Bridging the Gap in macOS Security Management
As organizations increasingly adopt macOS, security teams must ensure these devices adhere to industry best practices. Many rely on the **CIS benchmarks**, **NIST recommendations**, or **Apple's security guides**, but implementing these within **Intune** is not always straightforward. This repository aims to:

✔ **Simplify deployment** by translating security recommendations into **Intune-ready configurations**  
✔ **Enhance visibility** by leveraging **custom attributes, scripts, and compliance policies**  
✔ **Mitigate risks** by enforcing **proper security settings**, avoiding misconfigurations, and ensuring compliance
